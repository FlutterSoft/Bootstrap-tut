# Bootstrap Tutorial
Just working through the bootstrap tutorial by Traversy Media.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap5
Learning about common bootstrap elements and layout, as well as modals, forms and accordions. 

## Lessons Learned:

First impressions of bootstrap are that it seems like it would be quick once you get all the class shortcuts down. Copying different components seems sneaky and quick to build sites too!

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
